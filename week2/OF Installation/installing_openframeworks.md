If you have Mac OS X version less than 10.10.5 and newer or equal to 10.9.4 you should use xcode 6.2, which you can download from [here.](http://developer.apple.com/devcenter/download.action?path=/Developer_Tools/Xcode_6.2/Xcode_6.2.dmg)

If your Mac OS X version is less than 10.9.4 write me back and I'll let you know wich version to use.
